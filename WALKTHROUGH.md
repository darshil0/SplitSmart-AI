# SplitSmart AI Walkthrough

Welcome to the future of bill splitting! SplitSmart AI combines computer vision and conversational AI to make group dining stress-free.

## Step 1: Initialize
Enter your name in the top bar. This helps the AI understand when you say "I had the coffee" or "Add me to the pizza".

## Step 2: Upload Receipt
Click the "Upload Receipt" area. You can take a photo on mobile or upload a file. Our AI will:
- Extract item names and individual prices.
- Identify subtotal, tax, and tip.
- Handle different currencies automatically.

## Step 3: Assign Items
You have two ways to assign costs:
1. **Chat (Natural Language)**: Ask the assistant things like "Tom had the burger", "Divide the wine between Alice, Bob, and me", or "Everyone shared the appetizers".
2. **Direct Interaction**: Tap the 'Users' icon on any item in the receipt list to manually toggle participants.

## Step 4: Refine
- **Edit**: If the AI misreads a price, click the 'Edit' icon on the item to fix it instantly.
- **Distribution**: Choose how Tax and Tip are handled (Proportional to spend, Equal split, or Manual).

## Step 5: Settle Up
Check the **Summary** pane. It provides:
- A visual breakdown (Pie Chart).
- Individual totals including their share of tax and tip.
- A list of exactly which items each person is paying for.

## Mobile Tips
On mobile, use the bottom navigation tabs to switch between your **Receipt**, the **AI Assistant**, and your **Summary**.
